# Is PojavLauncher legal?

The simple answer is yes.

PojavLauncher follows along with the Terms that Mojang has laid out for its users, meaning that the following points still apply:

- Demo accounts are not able to log in.
- Offline accounts are restricted to single-player and offline servers. 
- Premium accounts get the full experience.
- Vanilla game files such as libraries, the client and assets are downloaded from Mojang server, not third-party servers.

There's no file modification or piracy happening with PojavLauncher, as you're still following Mojang's Terms when playing Minecraft. We do not support piracy, and do not provide support for those who attempt to get premium accounts for free or wish to interfere with PojavLauncher to bypass these restrictions.
