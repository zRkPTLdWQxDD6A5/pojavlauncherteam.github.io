# PojavLauncher

### From the ashes of zhouwei's Boardwalk project comes PojavLauncher, a capable, fast, and open-source Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android and iOS.

PojavLauncher is based off of **zhouwei's Boardwalk** project, which brought Minecraft 1.13 to Android. Improved upon and revived by the team, PojavLauncher brings Boardwalk to new heights with more versions, more devices, and even iOS support.

Right now, you're looking at the PojavLauncher website, with information regarding the launcher and wikis for Android and iOS. Take a look around, there's more in store!
