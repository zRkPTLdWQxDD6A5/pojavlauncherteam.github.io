# Offline mode is going places

Even though offline mode hasn't yet been taken down by Mojang, it's still technically piracy when you're using it, as you're getting the game for free (unless you bought it). Since GitHub and Mojang are owned by the same company, it's time we announce that we're putting our foot down.

In the future, offline mode will be changed to a new mode we call **local mode**. Local mode account users have the same restrictions as offline mode, plus some new ones:

* Local mode accounts will still be offline accounts, meaning that you're still limited by how offline accounts work.
* Local mode accounts are unable to download Minecraft through the launcher.

We're making this change to prevent any legal issues that could end PojavLauncher for everyone. For those of you who see this change as an inconvienence (due to lack of money, or some other reason as to why you can't buy Minecraft), we're also bringing **demo mode** to PojavLauncher. Demo mode will allow our users to continue to play and test even if they don't have the full game and adhere to the EULA of Minecraft. Obviously, if you own the game, you can continue to use offline accounts like normal (although you'll need to download new versions with the premium account).

We will not provide support for finding workarounds or acquiring Minecraft through other means if you do not own the game.

A couple months after we make this change and add demo mode to the launcher, we plan on removing local mode altogether.
