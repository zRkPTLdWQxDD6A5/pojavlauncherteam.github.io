# Optimizing Minecraft in PojavLauncher

## *Minecraft is a lot more fun to play when you're sitting at more than 1-8 FPS, which is common for older devices. This page will show you how you can improve your gameplay performance and experience.*

### 1- Messing around with Java arguments

**WARNING⚠️:Typing wrong arguments may lead your game to crashes, delete those arguments if you think that crash is related to those arguments.**
You can change Java arguments in order to increase your [FPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate)

* In PojavLauncher, Go to `Settings`

* Then Scroll down and select `JVM Arguments`

* Type the JVM Arguments you found (don't forget to put space in between, and remove spaces on beginning and end)

Your game should be faster/lower depending on the JVM Arguments you typed inside.

### 2- Lowering Resolution

Lowering Resolutin affects the performance a lot! You can increase it if you want better graphics than you have or decrease it to have more FPS.

* Go to `Settings`

* Then scroll down and use the slider to increase/decrease the resolution of your game

### 3- PojavOptimize

Originally made to help his OnePlus 6T, PojavLauncher Discord moderator Chuck_Norris_ has made [PojavOptimize](https://github.com/Doregon/PojavOptimize) , a collection of Fabric mods to boost performance,

That includes the mods;

- Sodium, a new rendering engine.

- Starlight, a rework of the light engine.

- FerriteCore, to reduce memory usage.

- Smoothboot, to reduce the load times for lower-end devices.

- OKZoomer, for OptiFine zoom controls.

- NotEnoughCrashes, to report more details on crash logs and allow you to keep playing.

and much more!
